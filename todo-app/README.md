## Features

- üìù **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- ‚úÖ **Mark as Complete**: Click to mark tasks as complete.
- ‚ùå **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
- üìù **Filter Tasks**: Click between tabs to filter the todo items by completion status.
- üé® **Beautiful Fluent UI**: Styled using Microsoft‚Äôs Fluent UI to ensure a consistent, polished user experience.

## Limitations

This project was developed as part of a time-limited coding task for a job application, so some areas could use further refinement and development. These include:

- **Responsivity**: While the app works on desktop devices, improvements are needed to ensure a fully responsive design for mobile and tablet users.
- **Accessibility**: The app follows basic accessibility guidelines provided by Fluent UI, but further improvements are planned to enhance compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
  
These enhancements will be included in future iterations to ensure the app is fully responsive and accessible for all users.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chelsea-designs/react-fluent-todo.git
    cd react-fluent-todo
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui) - Microsoft's UI framework for building consistent and accessible web apps.
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Tool to set up a modern web app by running one command.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
